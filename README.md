## Inscriptions

The Runetracker logo was inscribed forever on the Bitcoin blockchain.

It consists of two parts:
- The logo with the footstep
- The wordmark `RUNE TRACKER`

The logo was insrcibed on an `uncommon` `Alpha` sat and the second part on an `Omega` rare sat.
Alpha and Omega are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet.

> The block numbers contain only the digits 3, 5 and 8. The only exception is one instance of the number 2.

> For the inscription of the `RUNE TRACKER` image a fee rate of *33* sats/vB was paid with a special reason:
> 
> In numerology the number *33* is considered a "Master Number", which is believed to carry a higher spiritual vibration.
> 
> It represents pure love and a strong drive to make a positive difference in the world.

> Block *853,358* was also chosen with a reason:
>
> The number *853,358* is a palindrome, it reads the same forward and backword and it has the number *33* right in the middle.
