> For the inscription of the `RUNE TRACKER` image a fee rate of *33* sats/vB was paid with a special reason:
> 
> In numerology the number *33* is considered a "Master Number", which is believed to carry a higher spiritual vibration.
> 
> It represents pure love and a strong drive to make a positive difference in the world.
